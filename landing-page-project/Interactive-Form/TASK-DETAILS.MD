Task 2: Interactive Form
Create an interactive form that validates user input using JavaScript. The form should include fields like
name, email, phone number, and password. Display real-time error messages for invalid inputs and
confirmation upon successful submission.

Objectives:
Validate form inputs (e.g., required fields, email format, password strength).
Provide dynamic error messages without page reload.
Implement input focus and blur events for better UX.
Style the form for a clean and professional appearance.
